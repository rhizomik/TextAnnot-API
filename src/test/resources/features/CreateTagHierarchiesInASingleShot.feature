Feature: Creation of a TagHierarchies with its tags in a single shot
  As a Linguist
  I want to create TagHierarchies in a single shot
  So I can check if the tags associated to a hierarchy form a tree

  Background:
    Given  Exists a Project with name "default"

  Scenario: Create a Tag Hierarchy correctly
    Given I login as "admin" with password "password"
    When I send the "valid_tag_hierarchy.json" Tags structure for the "default" project
    Then The response code is 201
    And Its tags have the correct parent/child relationship

  Scenario: Try to create a Tag Hierarchy which its tags form a tree
    Given I login as "admin" with password "password"
    When I send the "tree_tag_structure.json" Tags structure for the "default" project
    Then The response code is 400

  Scenario: Try to create a Tag Hierarchy with an invalid json structure
    Given I login as "admin" with password "password"
    When I send the "invalid_tag_hierarchy.json" Tags structure for the "default" project
    Then The response code is 400

  Scenario: Create a Tag Hierarchy from a correct Excel CSV
    Given I login as "admin" with password "password"
    When I send the following CSV to create tag hierarchy of the project "default"
    """
    Level 1;Level 2;Level 3;Examples
    root1;son_of_root_1;grandchild_of_root1;example
    root1;son_of_root_1;another_grandchild_of_root1;example
    root1;another_son_of_root_1;;example
    root2;son_of_root2;;example
    """
    Then The response code is 201
    And Its tags have the correct parent/child relationship

  Scenario: Create a Tag Hierarchy from a correct Excel CSV File
    Given I login as "admin" with password "password"
    When I send the CSV file "SampleTagHierarchy.csv" to create tag hierarchy of the project "default"
    Then The response code is 201
    And Its tags have the correct parent/child relationship
